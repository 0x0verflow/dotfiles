# dotfiles
In case you want to be as cool as I am (or my btrfs crashes again and I need to recreate my dotfiles :/)


## Requirements
### ❤️ Core functionality
- xorg
- i3-gaps (and all dependencies like i3bar)
- feh
- picom (with experimental backend support, maybe only in AUR)
- i3status-rust (with material icons)
- conky
- xbanish
- dunst
- dmenu2
- urxvt -> rxvt-unicode

➡️ To install all needed packages on Arch Linux:
```bash
# pacman -S xorg i3-gaps feh picom i3status-rust conky xbanish dunst rxvt-unicode
# yay -S dmenu2
```

### ✨ For full functionality
- firefox/qutebrowser (awww)
- cmus
- pulsemixer
- htop
- nvtop
- thunar (you may want to install gvfs, too!)

➡️ To install all extra packages for full functionality on Arch Linux
```bash
# pacman -S firefox qutebrowser cmus pulsemixer htop nvtop thunar
```

## Thank you!
Thanks to all those awesome people who made this software and my desktop possible. Linux desktop wouldn't be as cool as it is without all of these packages! <3
